# AWS_GCP_Azure
Cloud Deployment for Machine Learning Projects This repository helps you learn how to put machine learning models into action using cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. It's designed for students and beginners in data science who want to learn how to make their models work in real-world scenarios.

My Cloud Deployment Adventures in AIML & MLOps
Hi! I‚Äôm building this repo to document my journey of deploying machine learning models on AWS, GCP, and Azure. This is my hands-on lab notebook for mastering the bridge between ML theory and real-world cloud systems.

Why Am I Doing This?
As part of my specialization, I want to:
‚úÖ Practice deploying models (not just training them in notebooks!).
‚úÖ Learn cloud tools that companies actually use for MLOps.
‚úÖ Build a portfolio to show employers I can turn ML ideas into scalable solutions.

What‚Äôs Inside?
This repo is my living playground for experiments. You‚Äôll find:

üöÄ Projects I‚Äôm Proud Of
"Sentiment Analysis on AWS" ‚Äì My first deployed model using SageMaker.
"Diabetes Prediction on Azure" ‚Äì Containerized with Docker and scaled on AKS.
"GCP Taxi Fare Predictor" ‚Äì A pipeline using BigQuery and Vertex AI.
üìö Learning Resources
Step-by-Step Guides : How I set up each cloud service (with screenshots!).
Mistakes & Fixes : "Why did my EC2 instance crash? Oh, I forgot to scale the instance type‚Ä¶"
Cost-Saving Tips : How I avoid accidentally spending $1000 on cloud credits.
Clouds I‚Äôm Exploring
Amazon Web Services (AWS)
What I‚Äôm Using : SageMaker (for ML), EC2 (virtual machines), Lambda (serverless).
Goal : Automate model retraining with GitHub Actions.
Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
What I‚Äôm Using : Vertex AI (for deployments), BigQuery (for data storage).
Goal : Build a dashboard to monitor model performance.
Microsoft Azure
What I‚Äôm Using : Azure ML Studio, Azure DevOps.
Goal : Create a CI/CD pipeline for my ML projects.
How to Follow My Journey
Tools I‚Äôm Learning
Python (obviously!), Docker , Kubernetes , Terraform
Bonus : GitHub Actions for automating everything!
Try It Yourself!
Clone the repo :
bash
Copy

git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo-name].git  
Set up your cloud accounts (use student credits if available!).
Follow my lab notes : Each folder has a "README" with my setup steps.

Suggest projects : Want to try deploying something together? Let‚Äôs pair!
Why Share This?
I believe learning in public helps everyone grow. Plus, my future self will thank me for documenting all these late-night debugging sessions.
