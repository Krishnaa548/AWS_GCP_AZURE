# My Cloud Deployment Adventures in AIML & MLOps

Hi! I’m building this repo to document my journey of deploying machine learning models on AWS, GCP, and Azure. This is my hands-on lab notebook for mastering the bridge between ML theory and real-world cloud systems.

Why Am I Doing This?

As part of my specialization, I want to

✅ Practice deploying models (not just training them in notebooks!).

✅ Learn cloud tools that companies actually use for MLOps.

✅ Build a portfolio to show employers I can turn ML ideas into scalable solutions.

What’s Inside?

This repo is my living playground for experiments. You’ll find:

🚀 Projects I’m Proud Of

"Sentiment Analysis on AWS" – My first deployed model using SageMaker.

"Diabetes Prediction on Azure" – Containerized with Docker and scaled on AKS.

"GCP Taxi Fare Predictor" – A pipeline using BigQuery and Vertex AI.

📚 Learning Resources

Step-by-Step Guides : How I set up each cloud service (with screenshots!).

Mistakes & Fixes : "Why did my EC2 instance crash? Oh, I forgot to scale the instance type…"

Cost-Saving Tips : How I avoid accidentally spending $1000 on cloud credits.

Clouds I’m Exploring

Amazon Web Services (AWS)

What I’m Using : SageMaker (for ML), EC2 (virtual machines), Lambda (serverless).

Goal : Automate model retraining with GitHub Actions.

Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

What I’m Using : Vertex AI (for deployments), BigQuery (for data storage).

Goal : Build a dashboard to monitor model performance.

Microsoft Azure

What I’m Using : Azure ML Studio, Azure DevOps.

Goal : Create a CI/CD pipeline for my ML projects.

How to Follow My Journey

Tools I’m Learning

Python (obviously!), Docker , Kubernetes , Terraform

Bonus : GitHub Actions for automating everything!
Try It Yourself!
Clone the repo :

  1.git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo-name].git  
Set up your cloud accounts (use student credits if available!).

Follow my lab notes : Each folder has a "README" with my setup steps.

Why Share This?
I believe learning in public helps everyone grow. Plus, my future self will thank me for documenting all these late-night debugging sessions.
